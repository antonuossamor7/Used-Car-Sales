## Overview ##
### Main Question ###
Is there any difference between geographic location (ie. weather, average income) and used car postings in 10 major cities across the US from 2017.
null hypothesis - There is no difference between geographic location and car sales.

### Cities picked ###
* Nashville, TN
* Atlanta, GA
* Miami, FL
* Houston, TX
* San Antonio, TX
* San Francisco, CA
* Seattle, WA
* Minneapolis, MN
* Chicago, IL
* New York, NY

## Running Codes ##
*Number of Listings per City*

*Price Average, Year Average and Mileage Average for the city of Houston*

After each plot add a sentence or too explaining what the code is and analyzing.
Your second requirement is to run linear regression on each relationship, only this time separating them into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):
